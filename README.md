php coding quiz

# Instructions
I think it's about time to practice coding.

- Create a file tree as we have been talking about all semester
- Please use some CSS to not make the assignmnet appear as browser default (nothing crazy, just make it look half decent)
- If you want to use bootstrap or something like that, that's fine, but don't let it take up all your time
- **welcome.php** - in this file you will have a html `form` that a user can enter their first name, last name, and email address
 - you can make the form to sign up for anything you want, be creative
 - make sure to name your inputs appropriately
 - you will check in this file for the cookie created in the next step
- **register.php** - in this file you will get and the `POST` data from `welcome.php`, process it and store the values to a cookie
 - next, if the user were to re-visit `welcome.php` after filling out the form, display the cookie values as "Hi, `first name`, you recently signed up with the email address: `email address`, thank you!"
 - if the user clears cookies, the form should appear again
- JS isn't required for any of this, but if you want to put something cool in there, I won't stop you.

### Points
- file organization - `10pts`
- styling (again, doesn't need ot be a work of art) - `10pts`
- php functionality works as described above - `30pts`
